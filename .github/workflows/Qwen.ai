with a full dark/light theme toggle, sidebar navigation, message input box with send button and keyboard shortcut (Enter), and chat area with bubble-style messages (different styles for user and Al). Include features like: conversation history on sidebar, ability to clear chat, copy response button, code block formatting with syntax highlighting, markdown rendering, auto-scrolling, typing animation for Al responses, and mobile responsive design. The Ut should look exactly like ChatGPT with smooth animations, rounded cards, soft shadows, and spacing. Also implement rate limit alert if API quota ends. Organize code cleanly in three files index.html, style (with Tailwind), and app.js with all Gemini API call logic. Final result should be a production-ready, ultra-premium Al chat agent web app with Gemini API.
